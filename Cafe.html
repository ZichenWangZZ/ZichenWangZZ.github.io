					<p>The cafeteria of the Diamond which is known as the Diamond kitchen is the most suitable place if you want to have a nice meal and also do not want spend too much money and the Diamond kitchen might be the best cafeteria in the university of Sheffield. The timetable of the cafe is made according to the timetable of students. It will open in the morning at 8:00am, and close at 10:00pm, and when it is close to the exam, the business hours would be expanded, which is very thoughtful. </p>

					<p>You can find various food from different countries on the earth, including noodles in Chinese style, panini in Italian style. All kinds of food here are delicious and cheap, but the only disadvantage here is that there is always no seat left to you. If that situation happened, you can also find some delicious cold food to take away and then enjoy, including different flavors of sandwiches, panini with hot chili chicken and pepper and various kind of burgers. The price of these elegant foods are pretty low, which is around 5 pounds. It is totally affordable for a student! If you have already bought some food from outside, you can still enjoy your food here in the Diamond kitchen, because the atmosphere here is good for eating and give you an enjoyable mood.</p>

					<p>I have to mention my favorite food is the pizza here, which is the specialty of the Diamond kitchen. The special pizza is made of pepperoni, cheese, ketchup and ham, and a whole pizza would only cost you 3.95 pound. The cheese is fresh, peppers are crisp, pepperoni and ham are smoked just perfect. I use to think pizzas with cheese are greasy and filling up with fat. When I tasted this pizza, I felt like I have not eaten any of other pizzas. It is not greasy to me any more and I do not even cared about the fat. I know that for my health, I should not eat that much pizza, but I just cannot stand live a single day without the special pizza in the Diamond kitchen.</p>

					<p>University life with the Diamond kitchen would be much enjoyable. This place is just like a port in the ocean of knowledge. When you feel tired after finish your daily studying task, going to the Diamond cafe would always be a nice choice. If someday, you find the pressure coming from your assignment or exam is unbearable, you can spend your whole night here and have a drink, or have some conversations which strangers, you will find that everything would be easier than before. You can also talk to Chris or Jack who work in the Diamond kitchen. All of staffs here are considerate and adorable, so some time talking to them will probably solve your problems.</p>
