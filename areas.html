					<p>First of all, I am going to introduce the computer rooms to you guys. As a computer science student, It is very important to be familiar with computer room. There are 3 computer rooms in the Diamond and there are hundreds of computers in each computer room! But we still couldn't always find a place in the computer room anyway,which is not only because there are lots of events hold in computer rooms everyday(such as online quiz) and also because students here would rather use computer in computer rooms than use their own computer because of the convenient system. When students want to use a computer  in computer rooms, they have to login by university account first, and then they can save their own work in their account which will save the work safely and only owner can see that. You are not allowed to install any software, but there are lots of useful software installed for you. </p>

					<p>Lab rooms are one of the most element of the Diamond. Most of engineering students will spend the most of their university life in lab.The lab rooms in Sheffield is world class and some of them even open for 24 hours per day and 7 days per week, such as iForge lab room. There are lots of 3D printers and laser cutters in iForge lab,  and as long as you work here as a volunteer 3 hours per week, you can use them as many times as you want, which would be an amazing experience for engineering students. As a computer science student, I don't have many chance to have labs in these lab rooms, but I am sure it is fun to create stuffs by 3D printers or test your circuit by some experimental instruments.</p>

					<p>If you find it difficult to grasp all of the knowledge in lectures, you can work hard in the study place or in the library on 3rd and 4th floor. There are thousands seats in study place and library, so finding a seats in these two place should not be a problem. There are also lots of computer, but as a computer science student, I do not recommend use computer here to do your assignments, because those programming tools which can be used in computer rooms are not available here, but you can still use the office software to work out your papers. If there is no computer left for you and you really need to use one, you can borrow one from the library and find a seat without computer in the study place. The outdoor study place is always used to form a group discussion, so it is a little bit noisy.If you want a quiet place to study, there is always a seat for you in the indoor study place.</p>

					</figure>
					<p>If there is no seat in study place or you are too tired to go to 4th floor, you can just find a seat in common area, which is my favorite place because it is more silent than the outdoor study place but you can discuss something here unlike the indoor study place, and you don't need to worry about if there are any seat left. The seats here are comfortable, and you can buy drink and snacks here.</p>
