					<p>In the morning, if you are going to have a lecture really early and have worked late last night, you can have a quick breakfast by using these vending machine which provides lots of choices of food and drink.There are different brands of soft drinks and hot drinks including cola, juice, coffee, tea, soup. Basically whatever you want to drink, you can find them here. And there are also lots of snacks including chips, chocolate and energy bar. But please remember that it is unhealthy to eat your breakfast here every day.</p>

					<p>After breakfast, there will be a lecture normally. The whole department would sit together in a lecture theater, so there is always full of people. Â Because the lecture theaters are open to everybody, so as long as you eager for knowledge, no matter who you are, you can attend most of these lecture. The lectures in the university of Sheffield are not always compulsory. Sometimes, if you think you fully understand this part of knowledge which will be taught in lecture , you can skip this lecture and use your time efficiently. You can also use the time of some lectures which are useless to you to attend some other lectures</p>

					<p>After morning lectures, it is probably the time for lunch. You can have your lunch in Diamond cafe which includes lots of delicious food from all over the world. I will introduce this adorable cafe in detail on another page. To eat in a restaurant near by the building is always a choice. There are plenty of nice restaurants around the Diamond, such as Chinese noodles and hot pot. And also you can choose to have your lunch on the west street, which is very close to the Diamond.</p>

					<p>In the afternoon, we are going to have computer class in the computer room in order to practice what we have learned from the lectures. For a computer science student, the chances to practice our programming skills are very valuable and important. For us, the experience is always more vital than intelligence, so that is why we can skip some lectures but we are not allowed to skip the computer class, even though there is no new knowledge to learn. The computer classes are not enough for us to practice, we always need to spend our spare time in computer rooms, which is a very vital step to become a engineer.</p>
